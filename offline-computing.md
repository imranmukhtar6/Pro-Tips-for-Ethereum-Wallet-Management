The Internet is a scary place, filled to the brim with malware and hackers seeking to take advantage of any possible security vulnerability on your computer to steal your secrets (especially your seed phrase and passwords).

- Why I prefer using SD Cards over USB Keys when transferring information between our "offline computer" and our normal "online computer"

- How to safely transfer data from 'insecure' SD cards that may be exposed to the Internet over to 'secure' SD cards
