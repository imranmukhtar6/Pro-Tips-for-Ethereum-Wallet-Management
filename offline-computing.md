The Internet is a scary place, filled to the brim with malware and hackers seeking to take advantage of any possible security vulnerability on your computer to steal your secrets (especially your seed phrase and passwords). That's why it's a good idea to store your secrets onto a computer that is *offline*, disconnected from the rest of the world.

In this chapter, we will learn:

- How to build our very own "offline air-gapped computer"

- Why I prefer using SD Cards over USB Keys when transferring information from our normal "online computer" over to our  "offline computer"

- How to safely transfer data from 'insecure' SD cards that may be exposed an "online computer" over to 'secure' SD cards that only interacted with the offline computer
