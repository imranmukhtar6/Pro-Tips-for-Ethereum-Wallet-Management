# Pro-Tips for Ethereum Wallet Management

## Written by Nick Dodson

As the Ethereum ecosystem grows, so does the wealth of every individual Ethereum. We are risking precious assets everyday by not handling our Ether properly. This book is designed to help give you some pointers and options for creating and managing offline and multi-signature wallets on Ethereum.

I do not consider myself a privacy or security expert in any way. This book is purely me passing on knowledge I have picked up about secure computing and key management over the years. Following these guidelines in no way guarantees in any way that any or all of your funds will be safe.

If you are a novice user of Ethereum or are not holding a significant amount of funds, this book may not be for you, so please consider just getting yourself a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S and backing it up properly and thoroughly. If you have funds stored in a third-party online service like a Coinbase account, a hardware wallet is generally recommended as a safer location to store your funds.

However, if you want to go deeper and empower yourself with some great tools and understanding available in the space, please keep reading, practicing and using this knowledge, within reason.

At the end of the book, we will show several recommended wallet setups for you to use, as well as ways of determining what "wallet setup" would best suit your needs and situation.
