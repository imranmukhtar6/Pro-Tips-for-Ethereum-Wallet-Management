# Pro-Tips for Ethereum Wallet Management

## Written by Nick Dodson

As the Ethereum ecosystem grows, so does the wealth of every individual Etherean. We are risking precious assets everyday by not handling our Ether properly. This book is designed to help give you some pointers and options for creating and managing offline and multi-signature wallets on Ethereum.

Note, I do not consider myself a privacy or security expert in any way. This book is purely me passing on knowledge I have picked up about secure computing and key management over the years. Following these guidelines in no way guarantees in any way that any or all of your funds will be safe.

This book can aid in the use and setup of privacy and cryptographic software. Many experts and community leaders have thoroughly read and signed off<sup>1</sup> on this book in the hopes it will help better secure the Ethereum ecosystem.

If you are a novice user of Ethereum or are not storing a significant amount of funds, please consider getting yourself a Ledger Nano S<sup>2</sup> and back it up properly. Then, read this git book only to increase your understanding of secure computing.

However, if you want to go deeper and empower yourself with some great tools that are available in the space, please keep reading, practicing and using this knowledge within reason for your own setup.

1 - See discussion in Private Google Doc. Should we keep this phrase in this book?
2 - Private Google Doc recommends mentioning "Coinbase" as well as an alternative. Should we add?
