### Why You Should Validate your Tails OS

The largest vulnerability of Tails is that it generally comes from a single source (i.e. the Tails webpage). While Bittorrent can be used to download the main ISO, state-level actors can replace the BitTorrent link and spoof the ISO download on the website. It is unlikely this will happen to you, but doing your own verification of the ISO is generally a good idea. The main focus is not on state-level actors but on smaller hackers or spoofers that just want to steal your funds.

While state level actors will always be a concern in the new internet we would all like to see, you can run some basic verification of the Tails OS by following these instructions (for Linux):
