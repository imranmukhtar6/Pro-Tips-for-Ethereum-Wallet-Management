### Validating your Tails OS

The largest vulnerability of Tails is that it generally comes from a single source (i.e. the Tails webpage).

While Bittorrent can be used to download the main ISO, state-level actors can replace the BitTorrent link and spoof the ISO download on the website. If the site was hacked, itâ€™s up to the community to figure out if the BitTorrent link/download is accurate and somehow warn you. It is unlikely this will happen to you, but doing your own verification of the ISO is generally a good idea.

State-level actors could certainly intervene on the connection, and replace out the file or link altogether, but it becomes more and more complicated to actually verify the download if a man-in-the-middle attack was activated on you. At that point, you literally have to rely on the developers of Tails or the Tor/Tails community directly to help verify your ISO. 

However, my main concern is not state-level actors, but on smaller hackers or spoofers trying to steal your funds or break things.

While state level actors will always be a concern in the new internet we would all like to see, you can run some basic verification of the Tails OS by following these instructions (for Linux):

This is why you should always verify your Tails OS download:
