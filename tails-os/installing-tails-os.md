### Installing Tails OS

1. Get a USB stick you're ready to completely format and erase.

2. Get a SD card for file storage.

3. Goto https://tails.boum.org/ on your Online Computer.

4. Follow the installation instructions for your OS (I recommend the torrent link).

5. Restart your machine and boot into the Tails USB.

Note: While unlikely, you should verify your Tails OS ISO image. Follow the tails verification steps on a linux machine. Here's the link to the steps: https://tails.boum.org/install/expert/usb/index.en.html
