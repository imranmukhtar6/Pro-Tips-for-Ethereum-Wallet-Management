## Introduction

This chapter details some recommended wallet setups for the very basic to the very expert users. These setups are rated based on difficulty level, with 1 being the lowest and 4 being the highest.  Please choose the difficulty level that is right for you and appropriate for your situation.

I have written additional tips and instructions for each step for each setup. Click the guide link beside each step, read and follow thoroughly before proceeding to the next step.

**Most of these setups involve a combination of the following 6 tools:**

1. [Ledger Nano S Hardware Wallet](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s)<sup>1</sup>
2. [https://www.MyEtherWallet.com](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)
3. [Ian Coleman's Bip39 tool](https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/)
4. [The Gnosis Multi-signature Wallet and dApp](https://wallet.gnosis.pm/)
5. [The EthOffline Transaction Signer](https://ethjs.github.io/offline/)
6. [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/)<sup>2</sup>

## Footnotes
1 - This is the first major chapter where we discuss in detail about Ledger Nano S, but we haven't really talked about what the Ledger Nano S *is*, allowing people to decide whether they should prefer using hardware or an offline air-gapped computer.
2 - I added in the sixth tool (Tails OS) in case we want to move this chapter to the beginning of the book rather than the end. That way, readers understand what TailsOS is.
