## Introduction

This chapter details some recommended wallet setups for the very basic to the very expert users. These setups are rated based on difficulty level, with 1 being the lowest and 4 being the highest<sup>1</sup>.  Please choose the difficulty level that is right for you and appropriate for your situation.<sup>2</sup>

I have written additional tips and instructions for each step for each setup. Click the guide link beside each step, read and follow thoroughly before proceeding to the next step.

**Most of these setups involve a combination of the following 6 tools:**

1. [Ledger Nano S Hardware Wallet](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s)<sup>3</sup>

2. [https://www.MyEtherWallet.com](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)

3. [Ian Coleman's Bip39 tool](https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/)

4. [The Gnosis Multi-signature Wallet and dApp](https://wallet.gnosis.pm/)

5. [The EthOffline Transaction Signer](https://ethjs.github.io/offline/)<sup>4</sup>

6. [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/)<sup>5</sup>

**Comments**

1 - Originally, the Google Doc mentions the difficulty  scale being from 1 to 5. However, the highest instruction provided is for Level 4.

2 - We may need more content explaining how one should pick the difficulty level best for them, possibly by teaching users how they define their threat model and then choosing the difficulty based on their threat model. We also need to try to stress that they are different options and that there's tradeoffs involved, especially with using the Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet (mentioned in Level 3 and Level 4). 

3 - This is the first major chapter where we discuss in detail about Ledger Nano S, but we haven't really talked about what the Ledger Nano S *is*, allowing people to decide whether they should prefer using hardware or an offline air-gapped computer.

4 - None of the instructions for Wallet Setup mentions the use of EthOffline Transaction Signer, even though we did recommend it in another chapter. I do think it's good to mention this list of tools, since we refer to them constantly through the book, so should we move this list to the Introduction of the whole book?

5 - I added in the sixth tool (Tails OS) in case we want to move this chapter to the beginning of the book rather than the end. That way, readers understand what TailsOS is.
