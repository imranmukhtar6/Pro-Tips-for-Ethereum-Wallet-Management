## Introduction

This chapter details some recommended wallet setups for the very basic to the very expert users. These setups are rated based on difficulty level, with 1 being the lowest and 4 being the highest<sup>1</sup>.  Please choose the difficulty level that is right for you and appropriate for your situation.<sup>2</sup>

I have written additional tips and instructions for each step for each setup. Click the guide link beside each step, read and follow thoroughly before proceeding to the next step.

**Most of these setups involve a combination of the following 6 tools:**

1. [Ledger Nano S Hardware Wallet](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s)

2. [https://www.MyEtherWallet.com](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)

3. [Ian Coleman's Bip39 tool](https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/)

4. [The Gnosis Multi-signature Wallet and dApp](https://wallet.gnosis.pm/)

5. [The EthOffline Transaction Signer](https://ethjs.github.io/offline/)

6. [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/)

**Comments**

1 - Originally, the Google Doc mentions the difficulty  scale being from 1 to 5. However, the highest instruction provided is for Level 4.

2 - We may need more content explaining how one should pick the difficulty level best for them, possibly by teaching users how they define their threat model and then choosing the difficulty based on their threat model. We also need to try to stress that they are different options and that there's tradeoffs involved, especially with using the Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet (mentioned in Level 3 and Level 4).
