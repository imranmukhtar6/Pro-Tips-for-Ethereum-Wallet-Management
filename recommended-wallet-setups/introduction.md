## Introduction

This chapter details some recommended wallet setups for the very basic to the very expert users. These setups are rated based on difficulty level, with 1 being the lowest and 4 being the highest.  Please choose the difficulty level that is right for you and appropriate for your situation.

I have written additional tips and instructions for each step for each setup. Click the guide link beside each step, read and follow thoroughly before proceeding to the next step.

**Most of these setups involve a combination of the following 6 tools:**

1. [Ledger S Nano S Hardware Wallet](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s)
2. [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)
3. [Ian Coleman's Bip39 tool](https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/)
4. [The Gnosis Multi-signature Wallet and dApp](https://wallet.gnosis.pm/)
5. [The EthOffline Transaction Signer](https://ethjs.github.io/offline/)
6. [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/)<sup>1</sup>

## Footnotes
I added in the sixth tool (Tails OS) in case we want to move this chapter to the beginning of the book rather than the end.
