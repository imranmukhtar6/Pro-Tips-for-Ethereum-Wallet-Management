## Introduction

This chapter details some recommended wallet setups for the very basic to the very expert users. These setups are rated based on difficulty level, with 1 being the lowest and 4 being the highest.  Please choose the difficulty level that is right for you and appropriate for your situation.

I have written additional tips and instructions for each step for each setup. Click the guide link beside each step, read and follow thoroughly before proceeding to the next step.

**Most of these setups involve a combination of the following 5 tools:**

1. [Ledger Nano S Hardware Wallet](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s)

2. [https://www.MyEtherWallet.com](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)

3. [Ian Coleman's Bip39 tool](https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/)

4. [The Gnosis Multi-signature Wallet and dApp](https://wallet.gnosis.pm/)

5. [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/)

Some wallet setups create "cold wallets", which are generally very safe to use. We'll indicate those setups with a ðŸŒ¨ emoji.
