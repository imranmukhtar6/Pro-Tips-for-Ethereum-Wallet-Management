### Recommended Tips

- Always do the initial setup phase of the hardware wallet offline. In other words, do not plug the device into a computer when setting it up. Plug it directly into a plug (i.e. a plug in the wall). This can prevent potential (but unlikely) setup vulnerabilities during the seedphrase and key generation step.

- Always buy hardware wallets directly from the manufacturer.

- Never use a hardware wallet that was used, given to you, opened or damaged in any way.

- Always appropriately and with the utmost caution backup your seed phrases during the initial setup phase. Please see ["Storing Seeds and Passphrases"](https://tra38.gitbooks.io/pro-tips-for-ethereum-wallet-management/content/password-management/storing-seeds-and-passwords.html).

- For advanced users: try setting up your hardware wallet with multiple pins and Bip39 passphrases. This allows you to have multiple accounts on a single device and enables [plausible deniability](https://en.wikipedia.org/Plausible_deniablity). We use these advanced settings for our harder recommended wallet setups, later on in the book.

- Do your research on the manufacturer and devices you are buying (make sure you know what you are getting and where you should/can go if you have problems).

- You can use MyEtherWallet to view and transfer cryptocurrency that are stored on hardware wallets, thereby taking advantage of MyEtherWallet's easy-to-use UI while keeping the security and safety of a hardware wallet.
