## Using a Hardware Wallet

Most high-quality hardware wallets on the market today usually have a setup phrase. This where you will generate your initial seed phrases (often a Bip39 phrase) and set your passphrase or pin physically on the device. The seed phrases can be used to generate keys for multiple crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The wallets will ask you to write down your seed phrase and will test you to ensure you wrote it down correctly. This is very important. If you do not write it down correctly you can, and most likely will, lose all your funds in the event the device is lost, stolen or damaged.

As mentioned earlier in this book, if you do not properly record and store your seed phrase, you can lose all your funds in the event of device loss or damage. Your seed phrase is your backup, make sure you write it down and secure it properly.
