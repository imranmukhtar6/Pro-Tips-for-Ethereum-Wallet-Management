** Comments **
The Google Docs mentions that we need more references and that they need to be in the proper format. I also don't know where would be a good place to put references within the book itself. After all, we already provide links to those sources elsewhere in the book. If we do need a reference section, should it be at the beginning of the book (in the Introduction section), or at the end of the book (after Recommended Wallet Setups)?
