Cryptocurrency is a rapidly evolving field with its own nuances and special cases. This book  started off as an initial draft in January 2018,  and there is always room to expand the book to cover more material...
 - New techniques in wallet management to evaluate and use
 - New ways of easily explaining security "best practices" to others
 - New security issues and dangers to learn about
 - New sections about cryptocurrency-related topics (such as estate-planning and hacks)

That's why we need your help to keep this gitbook up-to-date.

If you like this book, please chime in, provide feedback, and help maintain this gitbook so that the next generation of Ethereum users can benefit. We appreciate any help you can provide.

Thanks for reading.
