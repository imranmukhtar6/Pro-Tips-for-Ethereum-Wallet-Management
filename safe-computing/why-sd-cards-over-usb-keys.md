### Why SD Cards over USB Keys

SD Cards are simply a leaner and simpler flash memory chip than USBs (meaning they have less firmware and less accessible firmware, from what Iâ€™ve researched).

They are not good for medium to long term storage as the memory is not intended for long term storage use (life span ranges anywhere from 3 to 20 years depending on the chip quality, how often it is used, and if you win the factory lottery of having a chip with 20%+ good data storage blocks).

They can and have be infected with malware (as most contain a tiny microprocessor to fix their bad block management).

By design they contain simpler hardware than USBs, but still none the less have firmware of some kind.
