## Hardware Computing Preferences
- I prefer Apple hardware with hash-verified Linux on it.  PC with Linux is also very good.
- For mobile security, I lean iOS over Android.
- I also prefer SD over USB.
- No preference on cloud storage. Everything should be encrypted locally anyway.
   - Note that iCloud/DropBox/etc. appears to be very easy to hack (socially/digitally).

**Comments**
This page is also very small. Should this be merged into one of the other pages?
