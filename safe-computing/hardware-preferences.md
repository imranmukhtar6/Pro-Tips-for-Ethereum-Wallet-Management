## Hardware Computing Preferences

Here are my hardware preferences.

- I prefer Apple hardware with hash-verified Linux on it.  PC with Linux is also very good.

- For mobile security, I lean iOS over Android.

- I generally prefer Apple because of their software philosophies about application memory and processing isolation. Many people have varying opinions on this.

- I also prefer SD over USB.

- Generally I do not trust clouds and always assume anything I put on a cloud can be read by anyone on the internet (regardless of their claims). This is why local encryption of files is so critical.
