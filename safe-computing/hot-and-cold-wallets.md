## Hot and Cold Wallets?

There are generally two kinds of wallet classifications in cryptocurrency (hot and cold wallets).

Hot wallets are wallets that are connected to the Internet in some fashion. They are are usually very accessible and easy to use, but are less secure from threats. Examples of hot wallets are Metamask, Ledger Nano S, and accounts on exchanges (like Coinbase).

Cold wallets are wallets that are not connected to the Internet. They are usually less accessible to use, but are more secure. Examples of cold wallets are Multi-Signature Wallets and private keys that you keep on Offline Computers.

While this may be confusing, some people use hot wallets in their cold-storage setup [insert joke about "warm" setup]. For example, you could use a Metamask account (hot wallet) to sign transactions from your Multi-Signature Wallet (cold wallet). It's up to you to decide what grade of cold-storage you are personally after.

If you have funds you want to put away for safe keeping and rarely touch, you should setup a cold wallet system.  If you have funds you want to use though, you should setup a hot wallet setup, but use it sparingly. Keep enough funds as you need in a hot wallet, and store the rest in cold wallets.

Later on in the book, we have several "recommended wallet setups" that can walk you through the process of setting up a hot wallet or a cold wallet. We'll indicate the specific setups that creates cold wallets with a ðŸŒ¨ emoji.
