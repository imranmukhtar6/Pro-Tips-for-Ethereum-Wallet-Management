## Hot and Cold Wallets?

There are generally two kinds of wallet classifications in cryptocurrency (hot and cold wallets).

Hot wallets are wallets that are connected to the Internet. They are usually very accessible, with a lower grade of security tolerance. Examples of hot wallets are Metamask, Ledger Nano S, and your Coinbase account.

Cold wallets are wallets that are not connected to the Internet. They are usually less accessible, with a higher grade of security tolerance. Examples of cold wallets are Multi-Signature Wallets and private keys that you keep on Offline Computers.

If you have funds you want to put away for safe keeping and rarely touch, you should setup a cold-wallet system. We have several "recommended wallet setups" that can walk you through the process of setting up a cold-wallet.

While this may be confusing, some people use hot wallets in their cold-storage setup [insert joke about "warm" setup]. This will depend on the grade of cold-storage you are personally after.

Later in this book, we will recommend some common cold and hot wallet setups.
