## Hot and Cold Wallets?

There are generally two kinds of wallet classifications in cryptocurrency (hot and cold wallets).

Hot wallets are wallets that are are usually very accessible, with a lower grade of security tolerance. They aim to be more usable than secure. Examples of hot wallets are Metamask, Ledger Nano S, and your Coinbase account.

Cold wallets are wallets that are not connected to the Internet. They are usually less accessible, with a higher grade of security tolerance. They aim to be more secure than usable. Examples of cold wallets are Multi-Signature Wallets and private keys that you keep on Offline Computers.

While this may be confusing, some people use hot wallets in their cold-storage setup [insert joke about "warm" setup]. This will depend on the grade of cold-storage you are personally after.

If you have funds you want to put away for safe keeping and rarely touch, you should setup a cold-wallet system.  If you have funds you want to use though, you should setup a hot-wallet setup, but use it sparingly. Keep enough funds as you need in a hot-wallet, and store the rest in cold-wallets.

Later on in the book, we have several "recommended wallet setups" that can walk you through the process of setting up a hot wallet or a cold wallet. We'll indicate the specific setups that creates cold wallets with a ðŸŒ¨ emoji.
