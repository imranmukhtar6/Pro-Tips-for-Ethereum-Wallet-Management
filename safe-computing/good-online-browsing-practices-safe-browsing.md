### Good Online Browsing Practices

- Use a good Ad Blocker (for example, AdBlockPlus+).

- Donâ€™t randomly browse the web (without a controlled browsing environment, i.e. Tails).

- Keep your browser up to date.

- Use a password manager to generate, backup and secure your passwords.

- Remove any unused or random browser extensions.

- Make sure sites you transfer any sensitive data on are HTTPS.

- Verify URLs of important tools from multiple safe and public locations (within reason).

- Always assume software you are downloading is being spoofed or tampered with. Hash verification can go a long way (use GtkHash in Tails to conduct hash verification).

- When using Tails online, do not plug in or insert any storage devices such as SD cards. Select reasonable network settings when you boot Tails.

- Don't download everything you see on the Internet. Only download the very specific files you need and you intended to download, especially in the case of this book. Be reasonable here.

- Regularly monitor accounts and bank statements.

- Don't use unsecured or public WIFI; assume all data transferred over WIFI is compromised.

- Use a VPN; it can go a long way in protecting your privacy.

- Disable stored passwords in browsers.

- Don't use Windows for anything, ever (IMO).

- Always enable 2-factor, if available - use 2-factor apps like Authy/Google Authenticator and always remember to safely backup your 2 factor backup codes.
