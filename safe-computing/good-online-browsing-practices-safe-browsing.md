### Good Online Browsing Practices

- Use a good Ad Blocker (for example, AdBlockPlus+).
- Donâ€™t randomly browse the web (without a controlled browsing environment, i.e. Tails).
- Keep your browser up to date.
- Use a password manager to generate, backup and secure your passwords.
- Remove any unused or random browser extensions.
- Make sure sites you transfer any sensitive data on are HTTPS.
- Verify URLs of important tools from multiple safe and public locations (within reason).
- Always assume software you are downloading is being spoofed or tampered with. Hash verification can go a long way (use GtkHash in Tails to conduct hash verification).
- When using Tails online, do not plug in or insert any storage devices such as SD cards. Select reasonable network settings when you boot Tails.
- Don't download everything you see on the Internet. Only download the very specific files you need and you intended to download, especially in the case of this book. Be reasonable here.
- Regularly monitor accounts and bank statements.
- Don't use unsecured or public WIFI; assume all data transferred over WIFI is compromised.
- Use a VPN; it can go a long way in protecting your privacy.
- Disable stored passwords in browsers.
- Don't use Windows for anything, ever (IMO).
- Always enable 2-factor, if available - use 2-factor apps like Authy/Google Authenticator and always remember to safely backup your 2 factor backup codes.
