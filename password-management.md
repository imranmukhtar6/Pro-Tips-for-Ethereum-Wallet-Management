As we saw in the previous chapter, we can easily "recover" our wallet's private key simply by knowing the Bip39 seedphrase and the password. This means that anyone can gain access to your wallet's private key if they know your Bip39 seedphrase and password.

In this chapter, we will learn:

- the processes 

- How to use the KeePassX database to generate and store your passwords

In this book, we use the term "password" and "passphrase" interchangeably. For all practical purposes, they mean the same thing.
