As we saw in the previous chapter, we can gain access to our wallet's private key simply by knowing our Bip39 seed and password. While this is very handy for us, this also means that anyone can gain access to our wallet's private key if they know our Bip39 seed and password.

In this chapter, we will learn:

- The processes of generating randomness to make your password harder for someone to brute-force

- How to use the KeePassX database to generate and store your passwords

- How to safely enter your password into a computer without fear of being eavesdropped

- How to safely store your Bip39 seed phrase and password so that you don't have to worry about them being stolen

**Note:** In this book, we use the term "password" and "passphrase" interchangeably. For all practical purposes, they mean the same thing.
