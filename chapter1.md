# The Dangers of Writing This Gitbook

There are many security and community wide attack vectors that can happen after publishing an book like this:

1. Iâ€™m listing a specific set of recommended software tools and hardware, all of which can be spoofed, replaced or poisoned with malware. Please double check links, **hash verify or gpg software**, check with the community and friends on reddit or the forums before going ahead with any or all these recommendations.
2. If everyone starts to follow these instructions, it organizes a single attack vector for hackers (they can/will focus in on these tools and approaches with spoofing or code poisoning).

GitBook allows you to organize your book into chapters, each chapter is stored in a separate file like this one.
