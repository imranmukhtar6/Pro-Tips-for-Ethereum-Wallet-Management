Whenever you are connected to the Internet, there is always the risk that someone can gain access to your machine, either through hacking or social manipulation. Trust no one.

In this chapter, we will learn:

- The differences between "hot wallets" (wallets that are connected to the Internet) and "cold wallets"  (wallets that are not connected to the Internet)

- How you should deal with "hot wallets" and "exchanges" (places where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies)

- How to make your Online Computer safe (recommended online browsing practices, security tips from the MyEtherWallet, and my personal preferences for computing hardware)
