The Internet is a useful place, filled to the brim with valuable content to consume, interesting connections with people from all around the world, and incredible services (centralized and decentralized) for you to take advantage of. But you should *never* let your guard down here in this Wonderland. When you are connected to the Internet, there is always the risk that someone can gain access to your machine...and take advantage of that "access" to do mischief to your wallet.

In this chapter, we will learn:

- How you should treat "exchanges" (places where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies) and "hot wallets" (wallets that are connected to the Internet)

- How to make your computer safe (recommended online browsing practices, security tips from the MyEtherWallet, and my personal preferences for computing hardware)
