Whenever you are connected to the Internet, there is always the risk that someone can gain access to your machine, accounts or secrets, either through hacking, malware, spoofing or social manipulation. Be vigilant and you will thrive.

In this chapter, we will learn:

- The differences between "hot wallets" (favoured for practical every-day use over security) and "cold wallets" (favoured for longer term security over practical use)

- How you should deal with "hot wallets" and "exchanges" (places where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies)

- How to make your Online Computer safe (recommended online browsing practices, security tips from the MyEtherWallet, and my personal preferences for computing hardware)
