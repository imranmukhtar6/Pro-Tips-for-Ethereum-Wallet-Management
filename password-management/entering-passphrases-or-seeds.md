## Entering Passphrases or Seeds

- Remember when entering passphrases to use a combination of the keyboard and a virtual keyboard (like the Florence Virtual Keyboard that is a part of Tails OS).

  - To use the Florence Virtual Keyboard in Tails OS, click the keyboard icon at the top nav of Tails to prompt.

  - Consider entering rubbish in your physical keyboard and then delete it in your virtual keyboard as a form of misdirection.

- Keep electronic devices, cameras and microphones away from the device, preferably in a separate room.

- If you want to be really wild throw a blanket over yourself and the computer. Tin-foil hat not requiredâ€¦ yet.

I'd also recommend using an Offline computer with Tails OS installed. It is a good environment to enter, store or handle seeds and passphrases for anything.
