Most of the time, to gain access to a wallet, you need only a single private key. Multi-Signature wallets are wallet systems which require multiple signing keys to unlock funds and send transactions. Often in Ethereum, there are various multi-signature wallets to choose from. In this book we recommend the Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet, which is currently holding billions of dollars in funds without issue.

In this chapter, we will learn:

- Why people use the Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet

- How to withdraw some money from a Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet

**Note**: We do not recommend you store anything but Ether in the wallet (i.e. do not store things like ERC20 tokens).
