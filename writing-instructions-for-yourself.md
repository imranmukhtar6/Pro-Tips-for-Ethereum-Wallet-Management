## Writing Instructions For Yourself

Many pages in this book contains step-by-step instructions. These setup instructions can be complicated, so make sure to securely write and store instructions for yourself.

I would recommend writing them in Offline Tails, then storing them encrypted in a KeePassX database or an encrypted 7z archive.
