## Writing Instructions For Yourself

Many pages in this book contains step-by-step instructions. These setup instructions can be complicated, so make sure to securely write and store instructions for yourself.

Make sure that you can access these documents whenever you are handling funds.

This book generally recommends the use of Tails OS and the KeePassX password database in securing important information, such as these step-by-step instructions. I would recommend writing them down on Offline Tails*, then storing them encrypted in a KeePassX database or an encrypted 7z archive.

*"Offline Tails" refers to a computer that has the Tails OS installed and is disconnected from the Internet.
